# Blocks

This folder contains BEM blocks that are used by several different components. To differentiate between these global blocks and those that are used only by one component, I follow the traditional BEM naming convention `block-name__element-name_modifier-name_modifier-value` instead of the React-style convention `BlockName-ElementName_modifierName_modifierValue` used in other blocks.
